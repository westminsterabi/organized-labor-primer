I experienced a monthlong strike when I was abroad in the UK in 2018, and so I have more experience with academic strikes than many students at UChicago. *However*, I am no expert. Lots of people know more about organized labor than I do!

I also don't pretend that this is a neutral resource. I approach this subject from a left-leaning stance, and describe unions and labor movements from a sympathetic viewpoint. If that's not where you're coming from, I still encourage you to read up and understand the rationale behind industrial action.
