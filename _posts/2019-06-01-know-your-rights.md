The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) [protects the right to strike](https://www.nlrb.gov/strikes), but also notes that not all strikes are legal. *If* a strike is legal, *technically* the participants cannot be arrested or otherwise removed. 

HOWEVER, the right to strike has not been enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, and the Supreme Court has not made a declaration that striking is legal. In a 1988 case, the court basically operated under the assumption that workers have the right to strike, but only insofar as they ruled that striking workers can have food stamps denied to them. The U.S. lags far behind countries with a similar economic profile (like France, the U.K., and Canada) in this regard.

Moreover, just because a strike is legal doesn't mean that participants won't be arrested, intimidated, or otherwise prevented from striking by police. If you are arrested on a picket line, First Defense Legal aid has a hotline at 1-800-529-7374, which is available to anyone in CPD custody.
